<h3>WORKING</h3>
When the supply is on, the PZEM module starts monitoring the various electrical factors. The NODEMCU is programmed with <b>deep sleep mode</b> and recieves data from the PZEM after every sleep interval.This value is given to <b>Google sheets</b> which acts as the server that stores the sensor data. A <b>google script code</b> is written in the <b>script editor</b> of the sheet to write the sensor value to sheets. A code(also written in the same script editor) is used to send every new data written in sheets to <b>Firebase database</b>. The <b>Firestore</b> database of firebase is used to store the values, which is used as the backend of the <b>Mobile Application</b>.
